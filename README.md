# Predictive_Maintenance_Manufacturing
This project uses machine learning for predictive maintenance in manufacturing, aiming to forecast machine failures and optimize schedules. Through Random Forest modeling and feature analysis, I identified key factors affecting equipment health, supporting proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.
